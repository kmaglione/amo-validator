    Perform validation in one easy step!

    `path`:
        *Required*
        A file system path to the package to be validated.
    `format`:
        The format to return the results in. Defaults to "json". Currently, any
        other format will simply return the error bundle.
    `approved_applications`:
        List of approved application versions, provided either as a path
        to a JSON file, or as an appropriate Python data structure.
    `library_metadata`:
        Metadata for approved libraries and frameworks, provided either as a
        path to a JSON file, or as an appropriate Python data structure.
    `determined`:
        If set to `False`, validation will halt at the end of the first tier
        that raises errors.
    `listed`:
        Whether the app is headed for the app marketplace or AMO. Defaults to
        `True`.
    `expectation`:
        The type of package that should be expected. Must be a symbolic
        constant from validator.constants (i.e.:
        validator.constants.PACKAGE_*). Defaults to PACKAGE_ANY.
    `for_appversions`:
        A dict of app GUIDs referencing lists of versions. Determines which
        version-dependant tests should be run.
    `timeout`:
        Number of seconds before aborting addon validation, or -1 to
        run with no timeout.
    `compat_tests`:
        A flag to signal the validator to skip tests which should not be run
        during compatibility bumps. Defaults to `False`.
